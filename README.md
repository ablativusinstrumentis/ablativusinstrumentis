Good morning (it's always morning in this household), Iâ€™m Phobia/Eli. 

- Pronouns: anything but she/her, preferably they/them.
- Discord: @phobiathegreat
- Languages I "know" lmao: Python, C++, HTML/CSS, Java, Rust, SQL
- If you need to distract me throw a mildly interesting link. Congradulations you have three extra hours.
