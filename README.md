Good morning (it's always morning in this household), Iâ€™m Phobia/Eli. 

### -- Actually Useful Stuff Sometimes --
- Pronouns: anything but she/her, preferably they/them.
- Discord: @phobiathegreat
- Languages I "know" lmao: Python, C++, HTML/CSS, Java, Rust, SQL

### -- Objectively Useless Info Section --
- I like science/computers/math/languages/practically everything way too much(tm).
- More than 15 tabs open at all times, no matter how hard I try to clean them up.
- If you need to distract me throw a mildly interesting link at me. Congradulations you have three extra hours.
- Always open to talk about nerd stuff, remember to proceed with caution
